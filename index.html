            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My coding adventures began with COBOL, thanks to the big Y2K scare.  I was hired at Travelers Insurance Company, trained for 8 weeks in COBOL, and then placed in a job fixing dates in the system I was working in to accept a 4 digit number.  After 3 years, I was ready to learn more and was hired at Liberty Mutual, again into a training program.  This time I was exposed to both frontend and backend technology.  Once my training program was completed, I was placed in a position where I was mostly working with java.  I worked in this group for 4 years until my daughter was born.  I dedicated my time since then to raising my kids, but I am now ready to get my head back in some code!</p>
